# SimpleGroundVehicleModel
Dynamic Modeling and Path Planing  of Simple Ground Vehicle Using Simulink and MATLAB Script
This study was prepared for the project assignment of Guidance, Navigation and Control course at Istanbul Technical University.

USER GUIDE

The way the system works is explained in steps.

1-Enter the waypoints into the Path_Planning_Algorithm.m file at the specified location.
2-Run Path_Planning_Algorithm.m file.
3-Run the Ground_Vehicle_Model.slx simulink model.
4-Run the Results_Plotting.m file.

If the order is changed, the files will fail while running.
!! All files were created in MATLAB 2020b version !!

I wish you a healthy days :)
